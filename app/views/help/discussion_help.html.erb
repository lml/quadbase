<p>Discussions in Quadbase are different than what one would think, you can't specifically send a discussion to someone as you would in an email. Instead discussions are automatically generated when question attributes are altered from the default settings.</p>
<p> The alterable attributes include toggling role requests and adding a collaborator to a workspace. Settings regarding when discussions are sent to a user are personable, and can be edited under the account tab on the upper-right hand corner of every Quadbase page. Click on this tab, and you will see discussion settings towards the bottom.</p>

<p>These discussion settings are in the form of check boxes. Click on the boxes next to the setting you want to alter, and then click the update button near the bottom left of the screen. Here is an example configuration for discussion settings. </p>

<p> Play around with the discussion settings to see when you would prefer to be notified of new entries in a discussion</p>
