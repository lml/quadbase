class QuestionDependencyPair < ActiveRecord::Base
  # This class records a pair of questions in one of the following circumstances:
  #
  # 1) Sometimes if someone solves question A, it will be easier for them to 
  #    solve question B.  In this case, A is a supporting question to B.  B is a
  #    supported question of A.
  #
  # 2) Sometimes question A is required to be shown before question B.  In this
  #    situation, question A is called a prerequisite of question B.  Question B
  #    is called a dependent of question A.
  #
  # Generically, since question B depends on question A in both of these cases
  # we call question A the independent question and question B the dependent
  # question.  The two types above are separated by the "kind" attribute, which
  # can either be "support" or "requirement" for the two cases, respectively.
